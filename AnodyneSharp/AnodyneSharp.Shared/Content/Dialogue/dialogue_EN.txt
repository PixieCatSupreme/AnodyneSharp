### INSTRUCTIONS ###
####################
# 0. If you could comment out the english version when you translate that would be useful for me!
#
# 1.  - Any line starting with "#" doesn't need to be translated
#
# 2. SPECIAL KEYWORDS THAT SHOULDN'T BE TRANSLATED:
# Any line starting with: (where "..." is some other keyword , usually an NPC name or area name)

# 3. SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS SYMBOLS 
# ---------------------------- [SOMEKEY-C] means that this can change depending on what controls the user uses - it would be "C", "A", "ENTER", etc. Sometimes in the dialogue file I write
# Press [SOMEKEY-LEFT] #  set controls.
#
# And that implies that in-game, it will read "Press LEFT to set controls."
#
# 4. SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN DIALOGUE TO BE TRANSLATED
# -----------------------------------------------
# " and ' are for escaping the quotation characters. You can leave them like that. 
#
# ^  Denotes the player will have to press the progress-dialogue-button again to continue the dialogue - you can leave it there (or move it around as needed in the translated sentence)
# \n denotes newline, you can leave it there.

Good luck, Young.
Sage is right, in a way.  I want everything to be nice and work out perfectly, and sometimes that makes me ignore reality.
I don’t know what you need to do to help The Briar.  I don’t understand how this world works or why everything seems so strange.  But I do want to be your friend, Young.
You are fighting, Young.  You are trying to understand.  I hope you can work things out.

Mitra: I’m here to help my friend, Young..
Sage: Young doesn’t have friends.  Young doesn’t even have Briar.  And if you’re egging him on, then I want you out of my world!

Sage: You think you’re Young’s friend because you’ll lie to him and tell him that deep down he’s just perfect and everything will work out.  Well, if that’s what you want, FINE.  Get out of my face, Young.

Cloaked Man: Well, it’s about time.  Er...^I mean...^ Greetings, Young!  I am Sage, the Village Elder.  You have been summoned here because The Darkness has spread across The Land.  The Darkness seeks The Legendary Briar, to use The Briar’s power for evil.  You must reach it first. You must protect The Briar.	
Enter the active portal on your left to begin your quest.
*Sigh* it doesn’t bode well that you’re still dallying about here.  Enter the portal to begin your quest.  The Briar and, by extension, the world are in dire need!

Sage: At this point, you are still weak. If you hope to protect The Briar from The Darkness, you must face your fears.  The card you will find in this chest, and others like it, are symbols of your growth, so acquiring them is absolutely vital to your quest.
That key will also play an important role in your quest. You must seek out other keys, as well.  Select the map on the menu screen to teleport back to the temple's entrance, and continue your heroic quest.
Travel East and South through the temple grounds... you will find a use for that key.

Nothing.
# 1. Beach hint (no dungeons finshed)
Oh, you're lost? Have you looked around the beach? Maybe someone there can help you out. It looks like that key of yours comes in a set. Maybe you need to find more?
# 2. Forest hint (no dungeons finished)
Oh, you're lost? Have you looked in the forest to the east?  That key you have - it looks like it comes in a set. Maybe you need to find others?
# 3. Windmill hint
Look at all of those keys! I think I saw some gates to the southeast. Maybe you could use them there?
# 4. Generic hint to go past statues
Hey, I saw that you turned on the wind turbine!  Do you know if it had any effect on The Land?
# 5. finished 6 bosses, all 36...
Hey Young.  Wow!  You've really been racking up those cards!  Have you figured out what they're for yet?  Seems like you could really cash in with all those!
# 6. hints for go things
What is that new broom attachment you have?  It lets you alter the structure of the world...?  Honestly, that is really scary Young.  I'm glad it doesn't seem to work anywhere, perhaps just in the deepest, strangest recesses of the Land
# 7.  crowd finished but not redcave
How are my jump shoes working for you?  Pretty nifty, eh?  I’m loving my new bike shoes.  They make Wares and I an even better team!

Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nI remember there was a pretty grim looking path of flamethrowers somewhere. Something's gotta be at the end of it!
Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nThose circus folks have got to be hiding something. Did you look everywhere?
Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nHave you looked around the area on the perimeter of that couple's large pit?
Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nThere's this couple that like to hang around a pit. They must be hiding something.
Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nSometimes there are things hidden across chasms - especially in mountain caves!
Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nHave you scoured the highest parts of the mountain cave?
Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nIs there anything in the depths of that mountain cave?
Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nThat colorful cube in that weird place - it has probably got something!
Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nHave you talked to that grayscale cube in that wild-lookin' area? Maybe it knows something.
Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nThe top floor of that hotel is a little run down, but it's gotta have something!
Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nDid you walk into all of the rooms on the 3rd floor of the hotel?
Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nI bet someone left something lying around the 2nd floor of the hotel.
Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nThe owner of the hotel might have left something for you! 
Mitra: Hey Young, looking for a card?\nThose broken bridges to the northwest...look around there!
# and a bonus one if for some reason you make it this far without finding any...

Did you find that guy who was looking for something in the mountains?
Do you know what my bike’s surname is?  …Waldo!  Get it?  Wares Waldo!  ...Just kidding, bicycles don’t have surnames.
Do you think I should get a U-Lock?  I’d hate to tie up Wares like that, but you do hear a lot about stolen bikes these days...
So what is The Briar?  Some sort of ancient artifact from a lost culture?
I wonder why I haven't heard anything about The Darkness coming.  I guess most people in the land are just caught up in their own daily struggles.
Hey Young, I just wanted to tell you... your hair is awesome.

			How are you today? I'm the ruler of this partition and interpretation of space.
			You want to know why I'm the ruler of this place? I'll tell you, but it will take a while. Like, a long while. An obnoxiously long while.
			Like, quite a while. No really, I'm warning you! I tend to ramble. Maybe you'd be better off just scooping out the contents of that chest over there. Or heading off to the hotel in the distance. Don't know how that got there, I heard they have relatively cheap rates. Not that money matters here.
			LOOP
			Why am I the ruler?^...I'm not sure why, but my friends around here saw it fit to put me in this position, because of the immediate state of this space. Maybe this is the case because cubes are best at sitting still on flat surfaces. As for why someone needs to sit up here - that's beyond me!
			The others - my friends over there - have merits of their own. It's not like they couldn't sit up here in the future, they just can't do it now. Sometimes, we switch off who is the ruler, but every time, we always have to reinterpret this region of space! Perhaps Mr. or Ms. Pyramid comes up here because we decide to make the throne shaped in a way that best fits them, by re-imagining this world, so to speak. Does that sound silly? It might be. But that's how it is. It happens quite fast. Minutes, hours - not necessarily a long reign.
			Though, when I am ruler, it feels slightly strange...I somewhat feel isolated, wanting to be avoidant of others...
			...but isolation is not the right word, though it covers parts of the feeling. I'm not isolated, and I don't dislike the others. We consider ourselves all friends, but you know, no one really comes up here except to say a few words. So I have to think about things or I might go crazy! Maybe that's part of the isolation. 
			Outside of those inane questions about *why* we're here occupying this space, I'm curious as to why we're even friends.
			I like to think that whenever we're under the interpretations that I'm best to rule, that they give me comfort in being able to hold this position for as long as it takes to reach the next interpretation. You know, encouragement and the like, their physical presence, those are comforting.
			I suppose that's enough to satisfy me, though it would be nice to have one or two of them try and understand how I feel about being a ruler. Not that I'm complaining about encouragement! But maybe then, we could have multiple rulers...what a thought! Maybe that implies that when I am not ruler, I must act the same way I sometimes wish they would...who knows if that can be done.
			I've gone on too long. If you head off in the other direction, there's another similar region of space, though I think it smells a bit different. 
			It was nice to meet you.
			Oh, you want to hear my story again?
			Okay, sit tight.
		end scene

		Hello there. I'm the ruler of this part of space.
		What's that? You want to know why I'm here? Are you sure? It'll take me quite a few words to explain why!
		Well, if you insist. Though you might be better off just walking off to that hotel in the distance. Don't know why they went through with the construction of it. If I had any money to be taxed, I'd surely be complaining!
		LOOP
		Well, even though I'm the ruler of this part of space, I am not really ruling over anyone.
		Those friends of mine - they're all rulers of their own parts of space. Ruling no one really, either - we're all alone in that respect. But we're not alone in that we talk to each other, and in other ways we are not alone, too. This is just one place in which I exist.
		My friends and I - our parts of space have a lot of commonality to them in why they exist and how they're organized. Similar interests and desires, and the like. We like to talk a lot about how to rule, and so forth.
		But the tragic thing is that we rarely, if ever, get to meet eachother in the physical form. 
		So you're not actually talking to their physical forms, but a representation of them in some holographic form.
		I know, it's unfortunate. It's unfortunate because we share so much in common, but we can only help eachother as friends so much.
		There's just a small thing lacking when you can't have a one-on-one physical conversation all the time.
		But I'm not complaining. It's better than nothing at all! I can't imagine what it would be like otherwise. Something terrible.
		It was nice talking at you, good luck with whatever you're up to.
		You're still here? I can tell you everything again, if you'd like.

Today is a nice day.
Thanks for scratching that itch on my neck - I can't seem to reach it.
I've heard the eggs at the local diner are quite good. I have a coupon for them, too.
Did you see the car accident today? So horrible! He was texting. Such a shame, so young!
My son did not make the junior varsity team. Such a disappointment. We invested so much in his sports career.
Thanksgiving is today. I am thankful for a lot of things. Can't wait for tomorrow's early morning sales. Gonna get a lot of bargains.
Ah, I think I might be late for work.
I am in a bit of a rush to get home, I need to tidy up before the in-laws come over.
We're having a garage sale!
Welcome!

# inside of a house, olderkid
My friends like to listen to that 'None Surprises' song by 'Rayhead' and complain about this place. Sure, it's a bit of a bubble, but hell, at least show some gratitude! Or do something about it! They're all just...oh, sorry. I tend to do that sometimes..
I guess I'll just go write in my blog.
You sure look like you're in a daze.
I have trouble hearing my thoughts with sports and the like playing on the TV, but my parents like it.

My house has a lot of windows. I don't like windows. It's as if someone is always looking in. And you know there HAS to be something going on outside there. It can't just be that silent all the time, so silent and calm - it's disturbing to me.
Murderers? What? Outside? What are you talking about? Are you kidding me? There haven't been any murders in this town before, but still...you're starting to worry me...maybe you should just leave.
Please get out.

Hey, Young!
Are those bike shoes for me?  Wow!  Thanks, Young!  I've been thinking about getting these, since Wares has those pedals where you can clip in bike shoes.  Here, Young, take my boots in exchange!  They have these cool springs that let you jump really high! You press [SOMEKEY-X] to jump with them on!
Hi Young!  Notice anything new? ^... ^... Oh, well, I got new biking shoes, see!  They clip into Wares' pedals.  Since I'll no longer be needing my old boots, I want you to have them, Young!  They have these cool springs that let you jump really high! You press [SOMEKEY-X] to jump with them on!

Alright, take care!
Go on, try them out!  ...They're not THAT smelly.
Cool, huh?
Wow, are those the biking shoes from Finty's shop?  You're giving them to me?  Thanks, Young, I really appreciate it!  Here, try out my old shoes in return--I think you'll find them really useful!  There's an engraving on the shoes that says "Press [SOMEKEY-X] to jump".  I've never understood that, though, because there's no "[SOMEKEY-X]" anywhere on the shoes...
