About the project
-------------
AnodyneSharp is a fan rewrite of the game Anodyne by Analgesic Productions in C# using MonoGame.

It's based on the original game's source code, which can be found over here: https://github.com/analgesicproductions/Anodyne-1-Repo

The idea is that the original game's map files can be loaded and the game will be as faithful to the original game as possible.

The project is still work in progress, so you can't get the game's full experience yet.
