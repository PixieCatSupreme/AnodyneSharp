During game rendering:
1. before_fg_overlay
    during main game drawing, exclude fg sprites from overlay/hardlight/... blend
    
Applied on top of game screen
2. dec_over:
    either moving rain image in windmill(probably implementable as extra entity to draw), or street's overlay(overlay blending)
    (also used for suburb and drawer's static, but that's already replaced by a shader)
3. darkness:
    ***lights draw using a screen blend on top of this layer first
    
    alpha changed throughout with entities and other special events
    Applies an overlay/hardlight/multiply
    defaults to full black, 0 alpha in maps that don't have a specific blend, 1.0 alpha otherwise

**UI draws here**

Whole screen
4. death_fadein
    Fade game to white/black depending on map on player death(CELL fades to black, all other areas fade to white)
5. death_text
    UI layer drawn on top of death_fadein
6. black_overlay
    full-screen fadeout when needed

after-drawing shaders
7. unused disco effect? (REDCAVE easter egg)
8. out-of-bounds glitch effect
9. SUBURB/BLANK greyscale
9a. SUBURB before_fg_overlay a second time if in suburb, applied to the game part of the screen
10. downsample transition effect
11. horizontal wave effect
